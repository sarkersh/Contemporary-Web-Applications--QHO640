## 1. Introduction

In response to the challenge of helping Solent University students easily access relevant and location-based discounts and deals, I embarked on the development of a Student Discounts and Deals Web App. This project aims to bridge the gap between students and local businesses or online retailers offering exclusive discounts. The app is designed to cater to the specific needs and preferences of Solent University students by providing features such as location-based offers, deal notifications, product searches, useful filters, and user reviews.

The problem statement, "Solent University students struggle to find relevant and location-based discounts and deals easily," was initially derived in my first report, where I used the Design Thinking Methodology to conceptualize the project. In this report, I will provide insights into the methodology employed for development, the methods used for testing and data collection, and ultimately evaluate the implemented solution.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Scrum for Small-Scale Individual Projects

Scrum, often associated with larger teams and complex projects, has been adapted to meet the specific needs of my small-scale individual project. Dzhurov, Yani & Krasteva, Iva & Ilieva, Sylvia (2009) emphasize the versatility of Scrum and its adaptability to projects of varying sizes. In my case, Scrum provided a structured yet flexible framework that allowed me to efficiently manage the development process.

**2.1.1 Key Scrum Elements Utilized in this project:**

Although Scrum has many elements I have only used a limited set of these elements due to time limitations and the fact that many of the elements are more suited to a development team. Here the element I have used

**- User Stories:** I defined a set of user stories that outlined the app's functionalities from the user's perspective. These stories were clear, concise, and served as the basis for my development tasks.

**- Sprints:** I structured my project into short development cycles or "sprints." Each sprint typically lasted around two weeks, during which specific user stories were targeted for implementation.

**I- terations:** Continuous refinement was achieved through iterations. I reviewed and improved the app's features based on feedback and insights gained from each sprint.

### 2.2 User Stories, Sprints, and Iterations

**2.2.1 User Stories**:

As a student, I want to receive notifications about nearby discounts, so I can take advantage of them.
As a user, I want to filter discounts by category (e.g., food, electronics) for convenience.
As a student, I want to read reviews and ratings of discounts to make informed decisions.
As a user, I want to search for specific products or services and find relevant discounts.
As a student, I want to have a user-friendly profile where I can track my favourite deals and reviews.
As a user, I want to be able to login and register so I can access new notifications, leave product reviews and perform other tasks.

**2.2.2 Sprints:**

Sprint 1: Setting up the development environment and project planning
(- including firebase database and hosting setup).Â 
Sprint 2: Develop the UI elements and components in react js.
Sprint 3: Implementing the user registration and login system.
Sprint 4: Developing the location-based and category search features
Sprint 5: Creating the price and shop based search and filter functionality.
Sprint 5: Incorporating user review and rating features.
Sprint 6: Create the user dashboard and notification functionality.

**2.2.3 Iterations:**

Throughout the development process, I conducted regular reviews and retrospectives after each sprint. These iterations allowed me to refine features, enhance usability, and incorporate user feedback effectively.

## 3. Methods

**3.1 Data Collection and Testing Methods**
During the project's design phase, I employed the Design Thinking Methodology to identify the problem and gather user insights. I conducted surveys, and observation sessions with Solent University students to better understand their discount-seeking behaviour and pain points.

For user testing and data collection during the implementation phase, I employed the following methods:

**Usability Testing:** I conducted usability testing sessions with a sample group of Solent University students to evaluate the app's user interface and overall user experience.

**Surveys:** A comprehensive survey was distributed to a diverse group of students to collect feedback on the app's features, usability, and satisfaction levels.

## 4. Implemented App Features

Due to time constraints I have not managed to implement all the features identified in the design phase of the project. Below are the features implemented.

## Appendix 2: Development Code Snippets

***2.1 Routing: Routing method used - react-router-dom version 6.X***

I use the latest version of react router for routing as can be seen in the code below

```
const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <Root />,
        errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
        //loader: rootLoader,
        //action: rootAction,
        children: [
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <Index />,
                loader: dealsLoader
            },
            {
                path: "deal/:id",
                element: <ProductDetails />,
            },
            {
                path: "deals/",
                element: <Deals />,
            },
            {
                path: "login",
                element: <Login />,
            },
            {
                path: "Register",
                element: <Register />,
            },            
            {
                path: "dashboard",
                element: <Dashboard />,
            }

        ],

    }
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </React.StrictMode>,
) 
```

**2.2 Query Firebase: sample queries used**

```
 //Firebase Stuff
   const [deal, setDeal] = useState(null);
   const [reviews, setReviews] = useState(null);

   const params = useParams();
   const dealCollectionRef = doc(db, "deals", params.id);

    const getDeal = async () => {
        const docSnap = await getDoc(dealCollectionRef);
        if (docSnap.exists()) {            
            setDeal(docSnap.data());
        } else {
             docSnap.data() //will be undefined in this case            
        }

    };


     const getReviews = async () => {


         // Create a reference to the reviews subcollection of the deal document
         const reviewsRef = collection(dealCollectionRef, "reviews");

         // Get all the reviews documents from the subcollection
         const reviewsSnap = await getDocs(reviewsRef);

         // Check if there are any reviews documents in the subcollection
         if (reviewsSnap.size > 0) {

            const reviews = reviewsSnap.docs.map((doc) => ({ ...doc.data(), id: doc.id }));

            setReviews(reviews);

         } else {
             // Log a message to the console indicating that there are no reviews
             console.log("No reviews for this deal!");
         }

     }

    useEffect(() => {

        getDeal();
        getReviews()

    }, []) 
```

**2.3 Authentication**

**2.3.1 Email and password method**

```
 // create state variables for email and password
	const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
	const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
	// create a state variable for error message
	const [error, setError] = useState('');

	const navigate = useNavigate();

	// handle the change of email input
	const handleEmailChange = (e) => {
		setEmail(e.target.value);
	};

	// handle the change of password input
	const handlePasswordChange = (e) => {
		setPassword(e.target.value);
	};

	// handle the submit of the form
	const handleSubmit = async (e) => {

```

## Appendix 3: Technology Stack and Installation Guide

### 3.1 ### Technology Stack

The Student Discounts and Deals Web App is developed using a modern technology stack to ensure efficiency, scalability, and a seamless user experience. Here are the key components of our technology stack:

- **Frontend Framework:** React JS
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and building)
- **Backend and Database:** Firebase (Firestore for data storage)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (Email and Password plus Google Social Login)
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting
- **Other Libraries:** Material UI, React Icons, ant-design, headlessui

### 3.2 Installation Guide

To install and run the Student Discounts and Deals Web App locally for development or testing purposes, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository from GitHub:


`git clone https://github.com/sarkersh/Contemporary-Web-Applications--QHO640`

**Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change your current directory to the project folder:



`cd student-discounts-web-app`

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

Use npm to install the project dependencies:


`npm install`

**Step 4: Firebase Configuration**


- First, you need to create a Firebase project and an app on the Firebase console. This will allow you to use Firebase services such as Hosting, Authentication, and Firestore.
- Next, you need to install the Firebase CLI and the Vite CLI on your computer. You can use the commands
  `npm install -g firebase-tools` and `npm install -g create-vite` to install them globally.
- Then, you need to initialize your project by running the command `firebase init` hosting from the root of your local project directory. This will connect your project to your Firebase app and create some configuration files. You can choose Vite as your framework and select React as your template.
- After that, you need to install the Firebase SDK and connect your React app to Firebase. You can use the command `npm install firebase` or `yarn add firebase` to install the SDK. Then, you need to create a file called `firebase.jsx` in your src directory and import the Firebase services you need. You can also use the auto-init feature to automatically initialize the Firebase app with the configuration behind the scenes.
- Finally, you need to deploy your site to Firebase Hosting by running the command `firebase deploy --only hosting`. This will upload your files to Firebase servers and assign a URL to your site. You can also use a custom domain if you prefer.


**Step 6: Run your app locally**

Run the following command to start the development server:


`npm run dev`

This will launch the app locally, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.


**Step 7: To compile you app for production**

'vite build'


### 3.3 Deployment to Firebase Hosting

To deploy the app to Firebase Hosting for production use, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Firebase CLI**

If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI globally on your machine:



`npm install -g firebase-tools`

**Step 2: Log in to Firebase**

Run the following command to log in to your Firebase account:



`firebase login`

**Step 3: Initialize Firebase Hosting**

Navigate to your project directory and initialize Firebase Hosting:



`cd student-discounts-web-app firebase init hosting`

Follow the prompts to configure Firebase Hosting for your project.

**Step 4: Deploy to Firebase Hosting**
