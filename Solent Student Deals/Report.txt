## 1. Introduction

In response to the challenge of helping Solent University students easily access relevant and location-based discounts and deals, I embarked on the development of a Student Discounts and Deals Web App. This project aims to bridge the gap between students and local businesses or online retailers offering exclusive discounts. The app is designed to cater to the specific needs and preferences of Solent University students by providing features such as location-based offers, deal notifications, product searches, useful filters, and user reviews.

The problem statement, "Solent University students struggle to find relevant and location-based discounts and deals easily," was initially derived in my first report, where I used the Design Thinking Methodology to conceptualize the project. In this report, I will provide insights into the methodology employed for development, the methods used for testing and data collection, and ultimately evaluate the implemented solution.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Scrum for Small-Scale Individual Projects

Scrum, often associated with larger teams and complex projects, has been adapted to meet the specific needs of my small-scale individual project. Dzhurov, Yani & Krasteva, Iva & Ilieva, Sylvia (2009) emphasize the versatility of Scrum and its adaptability to projects of varying sizes. In my case, Scrum provided a structured yet flexible framework that allowed me to efficiently manage the development process.

**2.1.1 Key Scrum Elements Utilized in this project:**

Although Scrum has many elements I have only used a limited set of these elements due to time limitations and the fact that many of the elements are more suited to a development team. Here the element I have used

**- User Stories:** I defined a set of user stories that outlined the app's functionalities from the user's perspective. These stories were clear, concise, and served as the basis for my development tasks.

**- Sprints:** I structured my project into short development cycles or "sprints." Each sprint typically lasted around two weeks, during which specific user stories were targeted for implementation.

**I- terations:** Continuous refinement was achieved through iterations. I reviewed and improved the app's features based on feedback and insights gained from each sprint.

### 2.2 User Stories, Sprints, and Iterations

**2.2.1 User Stories**:

As a student, I want to receive notifications about nearby discounts, so I can take advantage of them.
As a user, I want to filter discounts by category (e.g., food, electronics) for convenience.
As a student, I want to read reviews and ratings of discounts to make informed decisions.
As a user, I want to search for specific products or services and find relevant discounts.
As a student, I want to have a user-friendly profile where I can track my favourite deals and reviews.
As a user, I want to be able to login and register so I can access new notifications, leave product reviews and perform other tasks.

**2.2.2 Sprints:**

Sprint 1: Setting up the development environment and project planning
(- including firebase database and hosting setup). 
Sprint 2: Develop the UI elements and components in react js.
Sprint 3: Implementing the user registration and login system.
Sprint 4: Developing the location-based and category search features
Sprint 5: Creating the price and shop based search and filter functionality.
Sprint 5: Incorporating user review and rating features.
Sprint 6: Create the user dashboard and notification functionality.

**2.2.3 Iterations:**

Throughout the development process, I conducted regular reviews and retrospectives after each sprint. These iterations allowed me to refine features, enhance usability, and incorporate user feedback effectively.

## 3. Methods

**3.1 Data Collection and Testing Methods**
During the project's design phase, I employed the Design Thinking Methodology to identify the problem and gather user insights. I conducted surveys, and observation sessions with Solent University students to better understand their discount-seeking behaviour and pain points.

For user testing and data collection during the implementation phase, I employed the following methods:

**Usability Testing:** I conducted usability testing sessions with a sample group of Solent University students to evaluate the app's user interface and overall user experience.

**Surveys:** A comprehensive survey was distributed to a diverse group of students to collect feedback on the app's features, usability, and satisfaction levels.

## 4. Implemented App Features

Due to time constraints I have not managed to implement all the features identified in the design phase of the project. Below are the features implemented.

## Appendix 2: Development Code Snippets

***2.1 Routing: Routing method used - react-router-dom version 6.X***

I use the latest version of react router for routing as can be seen in the code below

```
const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <Root />,
        errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
        //loader: rootLoader,
        //action: rootAction,
        children: [
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <Index />,
                loader: dealsLoader
            },
            {
                path: "deal/:id",
                element: <ProductDetails />,
            },
            {
                path: "deals/",
                element: <Deals />,
            },
            {
                path: "login",
                element: <Login />,
            },
            {
                path: "Register",
                element: <Register />,
            },            
            {
                path: "dashboard",
                element: <Dashboard />,
            }

        ],

    }
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </React.StrictMode>,
) 
```

**2.2 Query Firebase: sample queries used**

```
 //Firebase Stuff
   const [deal, setDeal] = useState(null);
   const [reviews, setReviews] = useState(null);

   const params = useParams();

    const getDeal = async () => {
        const docSnap = await getDoc(dealCollectionRef);
        if (docSnap.exists()) {            
            setDeal(docSnap.data());
        } else {
             docSnap.data() //will be undefined in this case            
        }

    };


     const getReviews = async () => {


         // Create a reference to the reviews subcollection of the deal document
         const reviewsRef = collection(dealCollectionRef, "reviews");

         // Get all the reviews documents from the subcollection
         const reviewsSnap = await getDocs(reviewsRef);

         // Check if there are any reviews documents in the subcollection
         if (reviewsSnap.size > 0) {

            const reviews = reviewsSnap.docs.map((doc) => ({ ...doc.data(), id: doc.id }));

            setReviews(reviews);

         } else {
             // Log a message to the console indicating that there are no reviews
             console.log("No reviews for this deal!");
         }

     }

    useEffect(() => {

        getDeal();
        getReviews()

    }, []) 
```

**2.3 Authentication**

**2.3.1 Email and password method**

```
 // create state variables for email and password
	const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
